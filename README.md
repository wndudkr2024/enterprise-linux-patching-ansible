# Enterprise Linux Patch Automation with Ansible

![Ansible CI](https://github.com/wndudkr2024/enterprise-linux-patching-ansible/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Production-style Ansible framework for automating patch management across RHEL-compatible Linux servers.

This repository demonstrates enterprise automation practices using role-based architecture and Infrastructure as Code principles.

---

## Overview

Managing Linux patching manually becomes difficult as infrastructure scales.

This project provides a reusable Ansible framework designed for:

* Enterprise Linux environments
* Repeatable patching workflows
* Environment-specific configurations
* Reliable and maintainable operations

---

## Features

* Role-based Ansible architecture
* Hierarchical inventories
* Environment-specific variables
* group_vars and host_vars support
* Security-only patch mode
* Full patch mode
* Package exclusion support
* Automatic reboot handling
* Pre-check and post-check validation
* Idempotent execution
* Patch execution logging

## Technologies

* Ansible
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
* Oracle Linux
* YAML
* Jinja2
* Infrastructure as Code

---

## Example Usage

Run against the development inventory:

```bash
ansible-playbook \
-i inventories/dev/hosts.ini \
playbooks/site.yml
```

Run in check mode:

```bash
ansible-playbook \
-i inventories/dev/hosts.ini \
playbooks/site.yml \
--check
```

---

## Design Principles

The framework is designed with the following goals:

* Maintainability
* Reusability
* Idempotency
* Separation of logic and configuration
* Environment-specific customization
* Production-style role structure

---

## Intended Use Cases

* Enterprise Linux patch automation
* RHEL lifecycle management
* Standardized patching workflows
* Infrastructure as Code initiatives
* Repeatable and auditable operations
